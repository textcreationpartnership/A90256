            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have endeavoured, not Paraphraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as ſome have done in many Authors, but punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, (as near as ſenſe and verſe could bear it) to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Poet in Engliſh word for word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and laſtly, Moſt of the Diſtichs in this book do comprehend Hiſtories ſo narrowly couch'd, and
<pb facs="tcp:170230:5"/>
chain'd together, that in the one Diſtich you will find ſometimes fewer, ſometimes three, or two, at the leaſt one. So that I may boldly ſay, there are not ſo many hiſtories of ſo few verſes of any Poet now extant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. All theſe hiſtories I have one by one, briefly and fully illuſtrated and explained, by collecting and comparing the ſeveral conjectures of the choiſeſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have walked in that path. The moſt that I have stollen in compoſing this ſmall piece of Illuſtration, was many hours ſnatch'd from night, and my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For the day was not mine, but dedicated to that <hi>Siſyphon</hi>-toil of the Education of Youth. And to add, as it were a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Firſt Phyſical; for under the ſhadowing names of fictitious Heathen Deities is covered the Body and Subſtance of Natural Philoſophy; Poets under Allegories expreſſing the wonderful works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, Ethicall; For the utmoſt ſcope the Poets aimed at, was not Fables, but Morality. Here be Precepts that will inform the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, reform the Affection, and direct the Will: Here are noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, inflaming the mind with candid emulation; leading, as it were by the hand, through the temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> to the temple of <hi>Honour.</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical: For let a skilful hand modeſtly draw aſide the curtain of Poetry, there will fairly appear the ſovereign
<pb facs="tcp:170230:5"/>
face of the Queen of all Arts, Divinity. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is plain and pithy; Many of the Poetical fictions, ſaith the Father, had their original from the Scriptures. And without all queſtion, as before Letters the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents expreſſed their conceptions in Hieroglyphicks, ſo did the Poets their Divinity under Fables and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. In Poetry you may diſcern an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. One God under ſeveral attributes and effects; Three perſons all Brothers, <hi>Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto.</hi> Their Enſigns a three-forked Thunderbolt, a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forked Mace, a three-headed Dog. Three Graces, three Fates, three Furies. In Poetry are deſcribed the Joyes of Heaven charactred by the Elyſian fields, the Torments of Hell deciphred in the burning lake of <hi>Phlegeton,</hi> and the Tortures of damned <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Publius Ovidius Naſo,</hi> a Roman Knight, of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family, one of the completeſt Gentlemen in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar's</hi> Court; a great admirer, and as much admired of the excellent Poets in that learned Age: He had an ample Patrimony at <hi>Sulmo,</hi> an houſe and Temple in the City, and another houſe near the Capital, with pleaſant Gardens and plentiful Orchards. But
<pb facs="tcp:170230:6"/>
in this ſo happy condition, in the one and fiftieth year of his age, he was baniſhed, or rather confined to <hi>Tomos,</hi> a City in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> bordering upon the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> The cauſe of this ſo cruel and deplored Exile is gueſt at more then known. Some do conjecture that it was for his too much familiarity with <hi>Julia</hi> the Emperours daughter; Others that he had unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen the inceſt of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But the pretended occaſion was, for the compoſing the <hi>Art of Love;</hi> and the Emperour to ſalve his own and his daughters honour, would have it thought ſo among the people. Having spent few years in this cold and comfortleſs Climate, he was poſſeſt (to add to his miſery) with this unwelcome news, That one of <hi>Rome</hi> whom <hi>Caelius Rhodiginus</hi> calleth <hi>Corvinus, Suetonius</hi> calls <hi>Hyginus,</hi> but the moſt <hi>Cornificus;</hi> (a fit name for a Horn-maker) had in his abſence ſolicited his wife, laboured against the Repeal of his Baniſhment, and being a great favourite of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> endeavoured to gain the whole eſtate of the Baniſhed Knight unto himſelf. Our ſmooth and gentle Poet, that never writ a virulent verſe before, being half horn-mad hereupon, in a jealous apprehenſion, lips his Quill in bittereſt Gall, and pens this laſt and leaſt, but beſt of all his Poems; Masking his Enemy (as the Greek Poet <hi>Callimachus</hi> did <hi>Apollonius</hi> that ſtole his Verſes, and publiſhed them for his own) under the ambiguous name of <hi>IBIS;</hi> a name more ugly then that D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:170230:6"/>
spued thence upon the land by Inundations: She uſ'd to purge her gorged panch by ſucking up ſalt water, and injecting it with her long Stork-like beak, into her narrow poſterior ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Many more things of this Bird are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Ariſtotle, Herodotus, Aelian, Pliny, Tully, Strabo, Mela,</hi> and divers others. <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in a Greek Epigram merrily concludes, that ſhe is more learned then <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf.
